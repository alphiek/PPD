    Polemi: `Extensive damage to the majority of the exterior surfaces and surrounding 
    walls meant they would need to be taken back before applying any paint work. 
    Pressure washing each surface to ensure all flaking paint and mould traces had been removed, 
    then allowing to dry fully before repairing the cracks and blown render work. The old decorative 
    gravel to the front and side was removed along with the weeds and dirt before being replace with new white 
    stone and the surrounding fencing sanded and stained to give a lovely finish.`

    Mesogi: `With flat roofs bearing the brunt of the Cyprus sun, cracks had allowed moisture to penetrate the substrate causing mould to 
    grow throughout the main hallways and bathrooms. Damage to the ceiling plaster work had already begun so it was important to remove any 
    loose sections allowing to air before treating and replacing. Removing any traces of bacteria and spores throughout prior to completing a
     colour match to the summery yellow walls and white ceilings.`

    Paphos: `A great rental property in Kato Paphos in need of sprucing up before the new season. The exterior spritz was still in good shape with
       only minor repairs and pressure washing needed prior to repainting. Damage to the underside of the balcony 
       was repaired and window and door surrounds edged in with white. Tricky spritz work was given several coats 
       to ensure an even coverage, allowing it to dry fully between coats.`
